## Introduction
Modern homes are increasingly equipped with IoT devices (thermostats, lights, cameras, etc.), but users often face the following difficulties:
1. Fragmented control across multiple apps and platforms
2. Limited automation and interoperability
3. Security and privacy concerns
4. Financially restricted important features (pay more to get monitoring service, etc)

With hype, I aim to solve this by creating a unified, intelligent, and extensible smart home ecosystem that integrates diverse IoT devices for seamless automation, monitoring and control. 

## Business Requirements
### Device Integration
Support for major IoT protocols, such as,
1. Zigbee
2. Z-Wave
3. Wi-Fi

### Unified Dashboard
Centralized control and monitoring from mobile/web apps.

### Notifications & Alerts
Real-time updates for security, energy usage, etc.

### User Roles
Admin, guest and child profiles with customizable permissions.

## Target Users
1. Homeowners seeking peace, convenience and security.
2. Property managers wanting centralized control across multiple properties they help manage.

## Business Goals
1. Establish hype as a premium smart home platform.
2. Drive adoption through partnerships with device manufacturers.
3. Unlock revenue areas via premium features and integrations.
4. Continuously stay on par with comparable veteran home automation systems in the market.

## Non-functional Requirements
### Performance
#### Scalability
Support thousands of devices per user across multiple locations
#### Response Times
Less than 200ms for local commands, less than 500ms for cloud-based actions.
#### Throughput
Handle concurrent requests from multiple users/devices

### Security
#### Authentication
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user access
#### Encryption
End-to-end encryption for data at all times (active and passive)

### Maintainability
#### Modular Architecture
Microservices design
#### Documentation
Developer guides, API references, and user manuals
#### Testing
Unit, integration and regression testing pipelines
#### Monitoring
Real-time system health and error tracking

## Other Considerations
### Interoperability
APIs and SDKs for third-party integrations
### Accessibility
ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) compliant UI/UX for inclusive design
### Localization
Multi-language support for global reach
### Offline Functionality
Local control fallback when internet is down
